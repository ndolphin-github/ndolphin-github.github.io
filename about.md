## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Seoul National University (expected February 2026) specializing in **physics-based simulation** and **data generation for robotic learning**. My research addresses the **fidelity-tractability trade-off** in simulating complex physical interactions, particularly involving **deformable structures** and **contact dynamics**.

To bridge this gap, I develop and validate **abstraction methodologies**, progressing from analytical models for real-time control, to data-driven surrogate models enabling reinforcement learning, and towards Neural Physics Engines (NPEs) for high-fidelity contact modeling. My goal is to create the foundational simulation tools and pipelines needed to generate high-quality, physically-grounded data for training the next generation of physically intelligent robots.
