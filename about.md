## About Me

I am a passionate and driven researcher with a Ph.D. in [Your Field, e.g., Mechanical Engineering] from [Your University]. My doctoral research focused on the development of novel tactile sensors and their application in robotic systems. I believe that a sophisticated sense of touch is the key to unlocking the next generation of intelligent, safe, and collaborative robots.

My expertise covers the full research pipeline, from theoretical modeling and material fabrication to algorithm development and experimental validation.
