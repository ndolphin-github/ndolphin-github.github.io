My Ph.D. research addresses key challenges in robotic touch. Below are summaries of my core projects.

### Project 1: High-Resolution, Flexible Tactile Sensor Array

* **Objective:** To design and fabricate a soft, conformable tactile sensor that can match the spatial resolution of the human fingertip.
* **Methodology:** We developed a novel, multi-layer capacitive sensing matrix using liquid metal electrodes embedded in a silicone substrate. This approach allowed for high stretchability and durability.
* **Key Finding:** > Our prototype achieved a spatial resolution of 0.75mm and could successfully classify textures with over 95% accuracy, outperforming existing flexible sensors.
* **Associated Publication:** [Title of Your Paper], *Journal of Robotics*, 2025.

### Project 2: Sensor Fusion for Stable Grasping

* **Objective:** To create a control system that fuses data from our tactile sensor and a wrist-mounted camera to prevent object slip during robotic grasping.
* **Methodology:** A Kalman filter was implemented to predict slip events based on subtle changes in the tactile pressure map and optical flow. The controller then modulated grasp force in real-time.
* **Key Finding:** The sensor fusion approach reduced object slip by 60% compared to vision-only or tactile-only systems.
